## Proposal 2
This data set describes two different scans of an MRI of dimentia patients. I would be wanting to determine which of these features has the biggest impact on somebody getting dimentia by using Linear Regression.

## Proposal 3
There are multiple different images of both pictures and paintings. I would use a neural network to see if I can train a computer to tell the differences between the two.
