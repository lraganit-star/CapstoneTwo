# Proposal 1
I want to use this MRI images and use neural networks to see if I can determine whether MRI images have a tumor in it or not. Challenges will occur with images that don't have as much of a contrast between the tumor and regular brain tissue, also the tumors aren't always stationary and are in different places in the brain. These tumors are also not the same size, so that will probably also cause some trouble for writing up the code
